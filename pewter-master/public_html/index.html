        <p>Thank you for visiting our website! Throughout this fall, we will be hosting our annual Pewter City Pokemon fundraiser, raising money for sick and abandonded Pokemon. Here's how you can help: </p>

        <div class="mycolor col-xs-6">
        The local Pokemon rescue league consists solely of volunteers and is in shambles. 
        You can help by providing funds that would go toward a new facility and help with
        staff salaries. It's all part of our $1 million capital campaign. Last year alone,
        they helped save over 1,000 Pokemon from abusive owners. Consider giving and helping
        out their great cause.
        </div>

        <div class="mycolor col-xs-6">
        On Feb. 27, National Pokemon Day, city leaders will be hosting a Pokemon are People 
        Too Walk. This walk is to demonstrate that Pokemon have been mischaracterized by 
        violent videogames and TV shows, and that they have feelings, too. No one should ever
        have to be kept in a Pokeball, and this walk will raise awareness. Cost for registration 
        is $50 before the event. Walk-in registration is $500.
