<p> Pewter City, affectionately known as "A Stone Gray City" by its residents, is a rocky settlement amid the Rocky Mountains. It's the site of two main attractions: the esteemed Pewter Gym, which is led by renowned fitness instructor Brock, and the Pewter Museum of Science, which contains fascinating fossil exhibits of ancient Pokemon. We hope you enjoy our unique location!</p>
