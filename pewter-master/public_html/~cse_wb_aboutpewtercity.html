<h1> ABOUT PEWTER CITY</h1>
</header>
<p> Pewter City, also called "A Stone Gray City" affectionately by residents is a rocky settlement amidst mountains. Here we have two main attractions, the esteemed Pewter Gym which is lead by our very own Brock, and the Pewter Museum of Science. Our museum contains fascinating fossil exhibits of ancient Pokemon.</p>
